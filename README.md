# Calculator-Java-
This calculator is an improvemente from the "Basic Calculator Project", added with some math functions as square root, cube root and power. I also want to add trigonometric functions such as sin, cos, tang, sinh, cosh, tangh and other math functions to turn this into a Scientific Calculator.
